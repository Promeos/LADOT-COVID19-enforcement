      "The use of the ROW in this way detracts from the quality of life for residents in the neighborhood.\n",

      "Tickets and tows will cause greater financial burden for low-income and unhoused people who are already struggling through the pandemic.\n",
      "The Safer at Home Order is still in effect and there is concern about a Fall surge of Covid-19 infections; now is not the time to lift any Covid-related protections.\n",
      "Impounding a person’s vehicle leads to extreme financial hardship, as individuals are required to pay tow fees and daily storage fees to the tow company.\n",
      "These fees quickly balloon to thousands of dollars and often lead to people losing their vehicles.\n",
      "In addition to the financial strain this poses, it will cause people to become reliant on public transportation, during a time when we are ordered to avoid groups of strangers.\n",
      "In particular, towing for expired registration will disproportionately affect low-income people who are already economically burdened by the effects of Covid-19.\n",
      "A car’s registration may lapse for many poverty-related reasons, including inability to pay registration fees, holds on registration until all parking tickets are resolved, and failing a smog test.\n",
      "Towing the car will only exacerbate these issues.\n",
      "The City’s current programs for low-income individuals to address parking tickets is insufficient.\n",
      "The Community Assistance Parking Program (CAPP) is only available to people who are already unhoused; people at imminent risk of homelessness or who are otherwise financially burdened by the tickets cannot access the program.\n",
      "The City’s Installment Payment Plans provide little relief because they either require such a large up front payment that is often impossible for a low-income person to pay or have so many restrictions that they are functionally unavailable for many people.\n",
      "Until there is a meaningful program to provide relief to people that cannot afford these tickets, the City should not resume enforcement.\n",

      "While the decline in revenue due to relaxed parking enforcement is understandably of great concern to the city, the livelihood of its residents must be prioritized.\n",
      "We are still in the midst of a pandemic and many residents are still working and learning from home.\n",
      "There is already a strain on available parking in many communities, and reinstating disruptive activities such as street cleaning will only create additional stress and worry for those struggling to work from home, serve as a teacher for their children, secure care for their children or dependent adults, and juggle any other tasks that have been thrust upon them due to stay-at-home orders.\n",
      "Additionally, thousands of families, especially those facing financial insecurity prior to the pandemic, would be greatly impacted by any additional costs incurred as a result of a parking citation.\n",
      "Moreover, unhoused folks, who are already some of the most vulnerable in our communities, would be most greatly impacted by the resumption of parking enforcement and street sweeping services by potentially further displacing them.\n",
      "Now is the time for innovative thinking and creative solutions to the city's fiscal challenges.\n",
      "For example, maybe the city can reduce costs by reducing the number and frequency of deployment of street sweeping vehicles and temporarily shift the roles of fleet operators to a different city service.\n",
      "Plainly, the loss of revenue is a challenge for the city, but recovering that revenue stream should not come on the backs of LA residents who are still dealing with the economic and social impacts of COVID-19.\n",
