# LADOT COVID-19 Transition Plan

## Goals
This project aims to analyze the Los Angeles Department of Transportation's plan to resume street sweeper services on 10/15/2020.

1. Use NLP techniques to analyze the intent of documents from City Council and the Department of Transportation.
2. Analyze the effectiveness of "public outreach" efforts using social media, news articles, and historical citation data.
3. Use Street Sweeping Citation data to determine the impact of "public outreach" efforts.
4. Recommend ways for LADOT to improve public engagement.

## Background

### Street Sweeping Stopped
On March 16, 2020, the Mayor of Los Angeles relaxed parking enforcement across the city, putting a __temporary halt to the issuance of street sweeping citations__.  This allowed residents to effectively practice the safe social distancing necessary during the outbreak of COVID-19. - [Source](https://github.com/Promeos/LADOT-COVID19-enforcement/blob/main/city-documents/city-council/LADOT-transition-plan.pdf)
- Once a week, Angelenos are required to move their vehicles to make way for street sweeping.
- If the owner does not move their vehicle, they receive a $73 citation.

### Street Sweeping Started: Did the public know?
Between September 1, 2020 and October 14, 2020 LADOT and City Council conducted public outreach to inform Angelenos on the timing of __resumed street sweeping enforcement__." - [Source](https://github.com/Promeos/LADOT-COVID19-enforcement/blob/main/city-documents/LADOT/enforcement.pdf)
- LADOT and City Council members used Twitter to spead the announcement.
- News stations did not cover the story until October 15, 2020 or later.
- LADOT placed flyers on windshields.

## Initial Thoughts
- Why did street sweeping services resume?
- What was the city's public outreach? Was it effective?
- How did residents react?
- Which streets and neighborhoods were effected the most?
- How can LADOT improve their outreach methods moving forward?

## Project Steps
### Acquire
__Parking Citation Data__
Download the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/cityofLA/los-angeles-parking-citations/discussion) stored as `parking-citations.csv`. The dataset contains approximately 7 years worth of parking citations issued in Los Angeles, California.

__Text data__
- Newspapers covering City Council, LADOT
- Twitter: City Council, LADOT
- Press Releases by LADOT
- City Council Public Documents


### Prepare
**Missing Values**
- Dropped rows missing latitude and longitude data. 99999.0 indicates null.
- Dropped rows missing license plate expiration date.
- Dropped columns: vin, marked_time, color_description, body_style_description, agency_description, meter_id, ticker_number
- Dropped rows with missing values.

**Data Type Casting, Metric Conversion, and Formatting**
- Converted all numeric date columns to datetime.
- Converted issue_time from a float to TimeStamp.
- Converted agency from a float to an integer.
- Converted latitude amd longitude values from US Feet coordinates \[NAD1983StatePlaneCaliforniaVFIPS0405_Feet projection] to standard coordinates.
  - Used folium and pyproj library to convert the coordinates.
- Removed capitalization and spacing from column names.
  
**Feature Engineering**
- Created a new column called `day_of_week`.
- Created a new column called `issue_year`.
- Created a new column called `issue_hour`.
- Created a new column called `issue_minute`.

#### Hypotheses
1. Fines collected from 10/15/2020 - 11/15/2020 significantly greater than average?
2. Was the public's sentiment of LADOT's enforcement on 10/15/2020 negative?
3. Public outreach efforts were ineffective.
